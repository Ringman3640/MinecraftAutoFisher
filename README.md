# Minecraft Auto-Fisher for 1.16+
Automatically fish for Minecraft versions 1.16+. 

## Dependencies
The AHK script for the auto-fisher requires the FindText script by FeiYue, which can be found here:

https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=17834

Ensure that the the FindText script file is in the same directory before starting the script.

The standalone executable does not have any dependencies.

## Usage
Subtitles must be turned on for the auto-fisher to operate. The script works by repeatedly checking the subtitles box for a fish catch.

Controls:
F1 - Start the auto-fisher
F2 - Pause the auto-fisher
F4 - Exit the program/script
